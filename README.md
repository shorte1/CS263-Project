Part 3 - 100 points (Due Monday, 5/13)
Part 3 of the final project will be your implementation and final report. You will submit a link to your website and a link to your GitHub repository. Do not make changes to your repository after the deadline, or your submission may be counted as late. Your implementation will be graded based on the following criteria.

-Usability - is your implementation done in a way that a user can navigate and use your website without any additional instruction?

-Educational value - does your implementation effectively teach a user about your topic? Does this content make sense for the personas you have developed?

-Interactivity - does your implementation have interactive elements that enhance the user experience?

-Aesthetics - is your implementation visually appealing?

-Document with an explanation of how you have met the requirements for the final project. Include this document in your GitHub repository.

    -For each of the criteria listed above (usability, educational value, interactivity, and aesthetics), explain how these are present in your implementation. I.e., tell me why I should give you full credit (or not full         credit) for each criterion.
    
    -Is there an aspect of your project that does not fit into the above criteria, but you put special effort into? E.g., making your website accessible to screen readers, making your website work well on a phone, etc. I         may consider giving extra credit for such work.
