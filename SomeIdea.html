                Backdoors in code come in many different shapes and sizes. The “original” backdoor, though, could be considered to be the worm. A computer worm is a self replicating virus where once it has infected a system, it will use various means such as the infection of emails to infect other systems and open up backdoors to be ecploited for everything from sending email scams to actually being used to seek out and delete other malicious worms. The largest weakness of backdoors is that they can usually be spotted simply by reading the code of a software, this is especially the case if there is one malicious actor working on a group or communal project. A relatively high profile example of such an instance is in 2003 when a contributor to the linux kernel simply changed a “==” to an “=” to create a nearly invisible backdoor, luckily it was found before it was distributed. A way people have attempted to get around this flaw is by simply making it more difficult to see, this can be done with things such as object code backdoors, where the backdoor is inside machine code which is considerably more difficult to parse by the human eye.

                Now the question is, how do you avoid being taken advantage of by these backdoors? There are a litany of things you could do but the best place to start is just a solid awareness of what you are downloading from the internet. Ensuring that you only install software from trusted sources is always a great place to start. If you want to go further, a robust antivirus program and a firewall are also very effective ways to either catch malicious software on your computer or prevent it from carrying out its intended function. Beyond that a big point of vulerability is online accounts and security details as people tend to reuse usernames and passwords so if someone is able to obtain the password to just one of your online accounts in spite of any security protocols you may have in place, chances are they can access a litany of other online accounts and services under your name. So a great way to avoid that is to use a password manager program that is able to generate unique, secure passwords for each account as they are needed.

                As for your own programs, there are many things you can do from the very beginning of development to ensure that your users are safe. The most basic security is simply to state when someone is downloading the software where they should be downloading it from so that they do not unintentionally download a version from an untrusted source with any malicious functionalities added in. Along with that there are several development tools such as Snyk that help identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in production. Beyond that there are several tests you can run after production is complete to ensure your program is not vulnerable to things such as injections and request forgery, all of which can be handled by basic contingencies within the code, but the lack of them will leave your code completely vulnerable to these relatively easy attacks.
