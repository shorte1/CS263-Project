                Backdoors, simply put, are sections of code that have some sort of vulnerability that allows a malicious actor to remotely run code on your computer. This can range anywhere from key loggers, which tell someone what keyboard inputs you are making, to full arbitrary code execution, possibly going as far as to fully seize control of your computer. Backdoors are usually the result of a mistake or negligence by the programmers but they can sometimes be placed into code intentionally by malicious actors. I common example of a backdoor is the trojan horse. A trojan horse is a program that seems legitimate but has a built-in backdoor that can allow for the execution of malicious code on any computer it is run on. A recent, relatively high-profile example of a trojan horse was a widely spread through a Minecraft mod in which someone had taken the mod and inserted a backdoor. They then redistributed it as if it were the original. Several thousand users of the mod were subsequently hacked and had all their personal data stolen from their computers. Another example of a backdoor is a built-in “admin” account with an unchangeable, default password so that anyone who has access to the computer or who can connect to it remotely can log in and gain high levels of access to the computer that they should by no means have. A big example of such a backdoor is from the 1983 movie, WarGames, where the military computer system has a hardcoded login that Matthew Broderick’s character uses to gain unrestricted access to military weapons systems.

                Now the question is, how do you avoid being taken advantage of by these backdoors? There are a litany of things you could do but the best place to start is just a solid awareness of what you are downloading from the internet. Ensuring that you only install software from trusted sources is always a great place to start. If you want to go further, a robust antivirus program and a firewall are also very effective ways to either catch malicious software on your computer or prevent it from carrying out its intended function. Beyond that a big point of vulerability is online accounts and security details as people tend to reuse usernames and passwords so if someone is able to obtain the password to just one of your online accounts in spite of any security protocols you may have in place, chances are they can access a litany of other online accounts and services under your name. So a great way to avoid that is to use a password manager program that is able to generate unique, secure passwords for each account as they are needed.
