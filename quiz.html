                 Backdoors are a near-constant threat in any sort of program, a threat that people have gone to great lengths to diminish as much as possible. But the lack of knowledge by the general public of just how dangerous a backdoor can be has led to a truly dangerous situation where companies heavily downplay the severity of backdoors in their software when discovered and they often do very little to fix the issue, much less compensate those affected.
